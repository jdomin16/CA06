# CA06
The Assignment CA06 - kNN Recommender Engine notebook is included in this folder, along with the instructions to follow, the responses to the questions for the assignment in a word file, and all the data need to follow the notebook.

This assignment will teach you how to create a recommendation system for movies. Basically, I created a model to get recommendations of what movies a person will watch next given the values from "The Post" movie. In the dataset, you can find movies rated with different values for IMDB rating and genre.

Check the assignment instructions for more information and better understanding.
